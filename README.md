# murmurHash typescript implementation

This is a typescript implementation of the murmurHash algorithm. The murmurHash algorithm is a non-cryptographic hash function suitable for general hash-based lookup. It was created by Austin Appleby in 2008. The algorithm is designed to generate a good distribution of hash values with a minimum of collisions. It is optimized for x86 processors, but it should work on any processor.

This implementation is based on the original C++ implementation by Austin Appleby. The original implementation can be found at github: https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash3.cpp
